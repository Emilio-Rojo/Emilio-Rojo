- 👋 Hi, I'm @Emilio-Rojo, I live in Brussels, Belgium.
- 😉 I'm super sociable and have great social skills.
- ☕️ I'm passionate about the world of specialty coffees, I took a barista course.
- 🧑🏻‍🍳 I love cooking, and I took a bakery course.
- 🎸 I play guitar and prefer Rock and metal.
  
I am a person who likes to solve challenges and I am excited about new things.

I'm currently learning Front-End and when I have mastered the subject I will learn Back-And, all in its own time.

My Goal is to become a software engineer, create functional websites, web applications and iOS app developer (maybe along the way I will change my goal, but for now that's it)

I hope to collaborate with the Github community and have their support.
